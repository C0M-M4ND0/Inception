            <h1>What is Docker ?</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update<br>and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application<br>source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that<br>code in any environment.<br>Here are the key concepts you’ll need to understand in advance of getting started with the<br>Docker platform:<br><br><span>Docker Engine :</span> This is the application you install on your host machine to build, run, and<br>manage Docker containers. As the core of the Docker system,it unites all of the platform’s<br>components in a single location.<br><span>Docker Daemon : </span>The workhorse of the Docker system, this component listens to and<br>processes API requests to manage the various other aspects of your installation, such as<br>images, containers, and storage volumes.<br><span>Docker Client : </span>This is the primary user interface for communicating with the Docker system.<br> It accepts commands via the command-line interface (CLI) and sends them to the Docker<br>daemon.<br><span>Docker Image : </span>A read-only template used for creating Docker containers. It consists of<br>a series of layers that constitute an all-in-one package, which has all of the installations,<br>dependencies, libraries, processes, and application code necessary to create a fully<br>operational container environment.<br><span>Docker Container : </span>A living instance of a Docker image that runs an individual<br>microservice or full application stack. When you launch a container, you add<br>a top writable layer, known as a container layer, to the underlying layers of your<br>Docker image. This is used to store any changes made to the container<br>throughout its runtime.<br><span>Docker Registry : </span>A cataloging system for hosting, pushing, and pulling Docker images.<br>You can use your own local registry or one of the many registry services hosted by third<br>parties (e.g., Red Hat Quay, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, and the Docker<br>Hub). A Docker registry organizes images into storage locations, known as repositories,<br>where each repository contains different versions of a Docker image that share<br>the same image name.</p>
