    Where does it come from?
    Contrary to popular belief,<br> Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br> making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, <br>a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,<br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,<br> consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,<br> and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,<br> discovered the undoubtable source. <br>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of<br> "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,<br> written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,<br> very popular during the Renaissance.<br> The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
